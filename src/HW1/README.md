# Lua to Python Decoder Homework 1
This repo is the submission for the first homework for the CSC591 Special Topics in Computer Science : Automated Software
engineering course. Within this repo a team of 4 aim to implement the latest and best software 
engineering practices to convert certain code from Lua to Python. Each Homework submissions
builds on top of the previous homework. Therefore, the functionality of classes in each 
homework would just increase as time moves.   

We will now delve into each file and understand the functions implemented in each class. 

## config.py
This file contains some important environment variables required to implement the 
functionality of all the classes in the homework.

## main.py
The main file is contains all the code to run the test functions. It coerces through 
the environment variables to find the system arguments and then stress tests all the 
various function that have been implemented in this certain homework. The tests
are explained in more detail under the `test_all.py` file

## misc.py
