# ASE 591 Group 37 Presents: Column Summaries

## Objective
The objective of this repository is to replicate, in python, [HW scripts](https://github.com/txt/ase23), which was originally written in Lua. 

This code reads in a .csv file and generates summaries of the columns. For numeric (Num) columns, this is median (the middle value of a sorted list of numbers thus far seen) and standard deviation (a measure of the spread of numbers).
